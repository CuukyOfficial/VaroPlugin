A versatile Spigot/Paper plugin designed for the Varo, ODV, SuRo, and Titan game modes. It features a built-in Discord bot that seamlessly broadcasts in-game events straight to your Discord server. With extensive configuration files and an intuitive in-game menu, almost everything can be adjusted to your liking.

**The plugin has not yet been fully translated into English, some messages may only be available in German!**

**This is a project I started years ago, don't blame me for old code.
This project probably describes my progress in coding - not the skills I have today.**
